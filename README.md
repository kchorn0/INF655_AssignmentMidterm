Task 1: Improve Greeting Component with Props and JSX (5 Points) Modify your existing Greeting component. Accept a username prop and display it inside the greeting message. Add a new paragraph that shows the current date using a JavaScript expression inside JSX. Add a button labeled "Change Greeting" that dynamically changes the greeting message when clicked. Example Output: Hello, Alice! Today's date: March 5, 2025 [Change Greeting]

Task 2: Add State and User Interaction to the UserInfo Component (5 Points) Modify your UserInfo class-based component. Add a state property called luckyNumber that stores a random number between 1 and 100. Add a "Generate New Lucky Number" button that updates the lucky number in the state when clicked. Display the lucky number dynamically inside JSX. Example Output: Name: John Doe Profession: Developer Your lucky number is: 42 [Generate New Lucky Number]

Task 3: Expand Task List with Dynamic Filtering and Sorting (5 Points) Update your TaskComponent to include a search feature. Add an input field that filters the displayed tasks based on the entered text. Add a "Sort by Name" button that sorts the tasks alphabetically when clicked. Example Output: [Search Tasks] [ Buy ] - Buy groceries - Buy office supplies [Sort by Name]

Task 4: Create a Task Management Form with State and Validation (5 Points) Create a new TaskForm component. Add an input field for entering a task name and a description field. Use useState to store and manage these values. Add a Submit button that adds the new task to the list of tasks. Add form validation to ensure the task name and description are not empty before submission. Example Output: [Enter Task Name] [Enter Description] [Add Task] The new task should appear dynamically in the task list.

Task 5: Add Delete Functionality with Confirmation (5 Points) Add a delete button next to each task in the list. Pass the delete function as a prop from the App component to the TaskComponent. Add a confirmation prompt before deleting a task. Example Output: - Task 1 Delete - Task 2 Delete Clicking "Delete" should ask for confirmation before removing the task from the list.
